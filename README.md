# Yum Culture

Yum Culture is an web application that allows users to browse through a selection of meals can be added into an individuals preferences.

# Features

- Sign up and Log in to create a user profile and add meals to a preference list.
- Browsing option that can be used to filter meals by categories for better viewing.
- Explore page that shows the most popular meal as well as a random meal.
- Forum where users who have logged in can write reviews on food items.

# Motivation

I love going to new restaurants to try new foods all the time. However, it can be difficult to pick an item that you can count on being excellent without knowing the menu beforehand. I created this application to allow users to find meals that they enjoy and add it to a list of preferences so that the application would recognize which meals were the most popular meals. Later on I want to continue adding restaurant menus and categorize the forum posts by restaurants.
